\title{Parallel function for MICE}
\usage{
parlMICE(data, n.core = parallel::detectCores() - 1, n.imp.core = 2,
  seed = NULL, m = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or matrix containing the incomplete data. Similar to 
the first argument of \code{\link{mice}}.}

\item{n.core}{A scalar indicating the number of cores that should be used. Default
is the number of logical cores minus 1.}

\item{n.imp.core}{A scalar indicating the number of imputations per core. The 
total number of imputations will be equal to n.core * n.imp.core.}

\item{seed}{A scalar to be used as the seed value. It is recommended to put the 
seed value here and not outside this function, as otherwise the parallel processes
will be performed with separate, random seeds.}

\item{m}{dont know}

\item{...}{Named arguments that are passed down to function \code{\link{mice}} or
\code{\link{makeCluster}}.}
}
\value{
A mids object as defined by \code{\link{mids-class}}
}
\description{
This is a wrapper function for \code{\link{mice}}, using multiple cores to 
execute \code{\link{mice}} in parallel. As a result, the imputation 
procedure is sped up, which might be useful in general.
}
\details{
This function is built upon package \code{\link{parallel}}, which is a base
package for R versions 2.14.0 and later. We have chosen to use parallel function 
\code{parLapply} to allow the use of \code{parallelMICE} on Mac, Linux and Windows
systems. For the same reason, we use the Parallel Socket Cluster (PSOCK) type.

On systems other than Windows, it is recommended to change the cluster type to 
\code{FORK}, as it is better in handling the memory space. When memory issues 
arise on a Windows system, we advise to store the multiply imputed datasets, 
clean the memory by using \code{\link{rm}} and \code{\link{gc}} and make another 
run using the same settings. For more tips about dealing with memory problems, 
we refer to Max Gordon's document *How-to go parallel in R – basics + tips*.

This wrapper function combines the output of \code{\link{parLapply}} with
function \code{\link{ibind}} in \code{\link{mice}}. A \code{mids} object is returned
and can be used for further analyses.

Note that if a seed value is desired, the seed should be entered to this function
with argument \code{seed}. Seed values outside the wrapper function (in an 
R-script or passed to \code{\link{mice}}) will not result to reproducible results. 
We refer to the manual of \code{\link{parallel}} for an explanation on this matter.

A vignette describing the use of `parlMICE` can be found in the \code{\link{mice}} 
package or through Github: https://github.com/gerkovink/parallelMICE/blob/master.

\dontrun{
# 150 imputations in dataset nhanes, performed by 3 cores  
result1 <- parlMICE(data = nhanes, n.core = 3, n.imp.core = 50)
# Making use of arguments in \\code{mice}. 
result2 <- parlMICE(data = nhanes, method = "norm.nob", m = 100)
with(result2, lm(bmi ~ hyp))
# On systems other than Windows, use type = "FORK"
result3 <- parlMICE(data = nhanes, type = "FORK", n.imp.core = 100)
